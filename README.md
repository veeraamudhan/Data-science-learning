# Data Science Learning

This repository contains my hands-on learning, practice notebooks, 
and projects as part of my journey to become a Data Scientist.

I am currently focusing on strengthening my foundations in Python, 
data analysis, machine learning, and applied statistics, with an 
emphasis on real-world datasets and business understanding.
